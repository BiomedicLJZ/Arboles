# Project Arboles

## Overview

"Arboles" is a project focusing on the implementation of different tree data structures. With a primary focus on C++ and Objective-C, the project currently supports AVL and Splay trees.

## Tree Data Structures

The following Tree data structures are included:

1. AVL Tree: An AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference of heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.
2. Splay Tree: A Splay Tree is a self-adjusting Binary Search Tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again.

## Features

- Each tree data structure supports insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- The project utilises smart pointers for automatic and efficient memory management.
- Const-correctness is maintained wherever applicable to ensure that methods should not modify objects when unnecessary.
- Comprehensive use of C++ STL.

## Usage

Include the relevant header file for the tree data structure you wish to use in your project. Create an instance of the tree and call the methods as necessary.
